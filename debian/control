Description: Kiosk compositor for Wayland
 Cage is a kiosk compositor for Wayland. A kiosk is a window manager (in the
 X11 world) or compositor (in the Wayland world) that is designed for a user
 experience wherein user interaction and activities outside the scope of the
 running application are prevented. That is, a kiosk compositor displays a
 single maximized application at a time and prevents the user from interacting
 with anything but this application.
